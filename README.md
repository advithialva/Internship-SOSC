### Number Guessing Game

The Number Guessing Game is a simple C++ program where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number within a limited number of attempts. It demonstrates basic input/output handling and random number generation in C++.

### Student Database Management System

The Student Database Management System is a C++ program that allows users to input and manage student data including names, usn, marks, and entrance exam ranks. It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, member functions, and encapsulation.

### Password Generator

The Random Password Generator project is a command-line tool for generating random passwords based on user-specified criteria such as length, the number of letters, numbers, and special characters. It utilizes Python's random module to create secure and customizable passwords.

- File: `miniproject3.py`

### Sorting Visualizer

The Sorting Visualizer project involves implementing a visualization of the bubble sort algorithm using Python's Matplotlib library. It provides a graphical representation of the sorting process, allowing users to observe how the algorithm rearranges elements in real-time.
